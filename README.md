# Dillon's Personal Website
This is my personal web developer portfolio website designed to hold my projects and be an online resume for potential clients.

## Design
This was my first dive into using and understanding css animations. Previously, I had used all Javascript based animation, but with this site I wanted to make performance a priority and learn some new things as well.

I used `materialize.css` for the form components and a few buttons. In later commits I will be limiting the materialize code in the codebase to only the components that I'm utilizing.

## THIS README IS A WORK IN PROGRESS
